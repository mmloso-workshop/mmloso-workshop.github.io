## 📖 <a id="about"></a> About

This workshop brings together researchers at the intersection of multimodal learning, NLP, and AI for social good, with a focus on low-resource and underserved settings...
We invite papers on developing robust and inclusive multimodal systems that can operate effectively under data constraints. Topics include learning with multiple modalities, cross-lingual, cross-modal adaptation, and interpretable models for domains like healthcare, ecological monitoring, education, and cultural heritage preservation. Alongside papers and keynotes, a community-driven shared task will evaluate multimodal robustness and generalization in low-resource contexts.

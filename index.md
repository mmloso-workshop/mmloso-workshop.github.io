## 📖 <a id="about"></a> About

This workshop brings together researchers at the intersection of multimodal learning, NLP, and AI for social good, with a focus on low-resource and underserved settings. While multimodal data—text, audio, visual, and sensor—continues to grow, most state-of-the-art models depend on large, high-quality datasets, limiting their applicability in data-scarce environments.

We invite papers on developing robust and inclusive multimodal systems that can operate effectively under data constraints. Topics include learning with multiple modalities, cross-lingual, cross-modal adaptation, and interpretable models for domains like healthcare, ecological monitoring, education, and cultural heritage preservation. Alongside papers and keynotes, a community-driven shared task will evaluate multimodal robustness and generalization in low-resource contexts.

## 📢 <a id="cfp"></a> Call for Papers

We focus on bridging the gap between the growing capabilities of multimodal machine learning models and the urgent needs of real-world applications in under-resourced, marginalized, or data-constrained settings. This includes scenarios where data is scarce, modalities are incomplete or imbalanced, and computational or human infrastructure may be limited.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- **Learning with Missing or Incomplete Modalities**  
- **Few-Shot, Zero-Shot, and Transfer Learning in Multimodal Contexts**  
- **Multilingual and Multimodal Representation Learning**  
- **Ethical, Interpretable, and Responsible AI for Multimodal Systems**  
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation for Real-World Robustness**  
- **Applications in Social Good**:  
    - Ecological and biodiversity monitoring  
    - Public health and epidemiology in underserved regions  
    - Language documentation and cultural preservation  
    - Crisis response, misinformation detection, and social justice

India is land of unmatched diversity, especially in terms of spoken languages. Many of these languages are tribal languages, which have a sizable number of speakers. But often, these languages are poorly documented and thus, lack the massive annotated corpora that power today’s NLP breakthroughs. Bhili, being one of them. Limited digital presence means the native speakers face barriers in health-care messaging, disaster alerts, e-governance, and educational resources—all of which increasingly rely on text mining and machine translation. By building open-source systems for Bhili ⇆ Hindi translation and Bhili sentiment analysis, this competition channels data-science skills toward tangible social impact: making vital information accessible in an underserved language and amplifying the voices of the native speakers online. In this competition you will:  
1. Translate from Hindi, a high-resource language (HRL), into Bhili, our focus low-resource language (LRL).  
2. Classify sentiment in the LRL (3-way emotion categories).

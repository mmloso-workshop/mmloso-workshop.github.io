# Shared Task & Competition
[‚Üê Back to main page]({{ '/' | relative_url }})

Welcome to **‚ÄúMMLoSo Language Challenge 2025‚Äù**! India is land of unmatched diversity, especially in terms of spoken languages. Many of these languages are tribal languages, which have a sizable number of speakers. But often, these languages are poorly documented and thus lack the massive annotated corpora that power today‚Äôs NLP breakthroughs. Limited digital presence means the native speakers face barriers in healthcare messaging, disaster alerts, e-governance, and educational resources‚Äîall of which increasingly rely on text mining and machine translation.

By building open-source systems for **LRL ‚áÜ HRL translation**, this competition channels deep‚Äêlearning skills toward tangible social impact: making vital information accessible in underserved languages and amplifying the voices of native speakers online. In this competition you will translate between high‚Äêresource languages (HRL) and our focused low‚Äêresource languages (LRL), i.e.:

- **Hindi ‚áÜ Bhili**  
- **Hindi ‚áÜ Mundari**  
- **Hindi ‚áÜ Gondi**  
- **English ‚áÜ Santali**

By tackling all tracks together, you will help push the frontier of multilingual NLP while building end‚Äêto‚Äêend pipelines that work in data‚Äêsparse settings.

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `bhili-train.csv`    | Data for Bhili ‚Äì Hindi translation training        | `row_id`, `hindi`, `bhili`                   |

## Tasks & Expected Outputs

| Task                   | What you submit                                                                                      | Where     | Metric                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Machine Translation**| `submission.csv` with columns:<br>`row_id`, `source_lang`, `source_sentence`, `target_lang`, `target_sentence` | On Kaggle | BLEU & chrF (tokenized, case-insensitive) |

---

### Evaluation Metric

Leaderboard ranks teams by a weighted composite score:

```text
Final Score = 0.6 √ó BLEU + 0.4 √ó chrF

> *Why 0.6 / 0.4?* Translation quality is harder to push in low-resource settings; the higher weight reflects its research importance.

- **Short papers (up to 4 pages):** This format is ideal for presenting more focused contributions, including preliminary work, work-in-progress, position papers, or descriptions of systems.

📅 **Submission link:** [OpenReview Submission Portal](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/AACL-IJCNLP/2025/Workshop/MMLoSo)  
📑 **Review process:** Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Submissions will be evaluated based on technical soundness, relevance, significance, originality, and clarity.
